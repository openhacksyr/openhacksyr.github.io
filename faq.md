## What is OpenHack?
It is a gathering of like-minded individuals. It’s a place for those of us who
spend our free time writing code or pushing pixels.

OpenHack Syracuse is our local fork of the
[OpenHack meetup group](http://openhack.github.io).

## When do we meet?
We typically meet on the second Tuesday of every month.

Meetings start at 6, and we generally wrap up around 9pm. If there’s interest,
we will head to a nearby coffee shop or bar for more discussion.

## Sounds great, where do we meet?

## What is the meeting format?
**Each** meeting starts out with introductions. We go around the room, and
answer the following questions:

- What you do
- What you're working on (if you have a project)
- If you'd like any help, or would like to offer help

Then, we get to work.
