OpenHack Syracuse is a casual social coding meetup with a simple purpose:  
**Code together, on anything.**

We welcome local developers and designers of _all_ skill levels, interests, ages
genders, _you-name-it_ to get together to write code or push pixels. We'll
provide good food, good people, and creative energy.

Here's how OpenHack works:

* You can hack on anything! Any language, framework, public/open-source,
personal projects, client work... anything!
* You don’t have to have an idea to hack on, you can come join someone else
* We'll kick things off with a quick round of introductions, to say who you are,
what you’re working on, and if you’d like help with your idea
* Food and drinks will be provided

Feel free to join us - bring a laptop, a project, and a friend!
